Ever wanted to know for how long you played BeatSaber? Or Blade and Sorcery? But you are on Quest? Time Tracker is an app that keeps track of how long you are playing and then you can see your Playtime to show it of to your friends.

Sounds nice?

## Getting Started
**I recommend installing it through [SideQuest](https://sidequestvr.com/app/39121/time-tracker). SideQuest also has fantastic guides that help you sideloading an app.**
1. Download the App from [SideQuest](https://sidequestvr.com/app/39121/time-tracker) or [releases](https://github.com/Sajeg/TimeTracker/releases)
2. Start it and give it access to your usage data
3. Enjoy the app
